# Lumen Light Companion

Lumen Light Companion is a touch-native control surface for a hosted Lumen Light
whiteboard.

It is not a phone-sized whiteboard. The hosted surface remains the canonical
workspace. The companion turns a phone or tablet into a nearby interaction layer:
touch control, finger ink, haptic feedback, microphone capture, and eventually
camera-based gesture input for drawing or manipulating objects in the air.

The goal is to make live conversation surfaces easier to steer while preserving a
single durable source of truth in the hosted Lumen session.

## Why it exists

Large shared thinking surfaces are useful when they remain visible: a monitor,
projector, desktop browser, wall display, or collaboration host. Phones are
useful because they are personal, touch-native, sensor-rich, and physically close
to the user.

Lumen Light Companion connects those strengths. The host shows the workspace.
The companion provides direct manipulation, close-range audio, haptic state
feedback, and optional gesture sensing without splitting the whiteboard into a
separate mobile copy.

## Core idea

```text
touch / mic / camera / sensors
        |
        v
Lumen Light Companion
        |
        v
paired input + media events
        |
        v
hosted Lumen Light session
        |
        v
surface updates + feedback events
        |
        v
haptics / status / controls
```

The companion emits commands. The host owns state.

## What Lumen Light Companion manages

- Touch selection, drag, resize, pan, zoom, and approve/reject controls.
- Finger ink that appears on the hosted whiteboard.
- Haptic responses for selection, snapping, staged changes, recording state, and
  accepted or rejected updates.
- Phone microphone capture for the hosted session transcript and turn queue.
- Camera or webcam gesture input for air drawing and hand-based commands.
- Pairing and session presence for a single hosted Lumen surface.
- Public-safe event contracts for companion-to-host and host-to-companion flow.

## Design principles

- The host owns canonical session state.
- The companion is an input and feedback layer, not a competing workspace.
- Touch, voice, haptics, and gesture events should share one event contract.
- Raw media should be minimized; derived commands and explicit consent matter.
- Haptic feedback should communicate state, not distract.
- Companion features should degrade gracefully when sensors are unavailable.
- Public examples must stay synthetic and deployment-neutral.

## Current status

This repository is an early product scaffold. It captures the companion concept,
initial product requirements, protocol boundaries, and one synthetic event
example. It does not yet contain Android application code.

The next technical milestone is to define the companion event schema after the
hosted Lumen Light session/object protocol stabilizes.

Run the public-safe validation check:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 scripts/validate_companion_event.py examples/companion-event.example.json
```

Expected output:

```text
LUMEN_LIGHT_COMPANION_EVENT_OK
```

## Public/private model

Use this repository as the generic upstream. Keep environment-specific
customizations in private downstream repositories or private branches.

```text
empathos/lumen-light-companion     public generic framework
private downstream fork            local devices, pairing, credentials, logs
```

This keeps the public framework reusable while preserving operational privacy.
